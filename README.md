# Introduction
###An average of 2.5 million car crashes occur annually from which 1.3 million people die. Drunk and reckless drivers are the cause of around 10 thousand deaths each year in the United States alone.  With the implementation of autonomous cars, thousands of lives can be spared. Large corporations such as Tesla and Google, have worked around the idea of self driving cars  for quite some time with the use of machine learning concepts. Convolutional neural networks (CNN), can be used for the identification of various road signs, however the result must be extremely accurate as it is a matter of life and death. So, how effective are different CNN architectures for classifying a road sign as a traffic light, stop sign, speed limit or crosswalk sign?
